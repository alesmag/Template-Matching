## About the Project

Template Matching is a personal project developed to test image recognition through given templates. 

## Usage

The scope of this project is to find a given template inside an image.
Choose an image of your liking and rename it to "image.jpg", then select an object or a portion of this image, which you want the program to find, and rename this to "template.jgp". 
The "image.jpg" will be where the program will look for the "tempalte.jpg" image.

Examples are already present inside each folder.

SingleMatching will find a single occurrence of the template, whereas MultipleMatching will find all occurrences of the template.

To run the program in single matching, run:
```sh
python SingleMatching.py
```

To run the program in multiple matching, run:
```sh
python MultipleMatching.py
```
